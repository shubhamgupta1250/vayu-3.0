# VAYU Platform Overview

## Read This First (Non-Technical Overview)

This section is written for people who are not from a technical background. It explains:
- what problem VAYU is solving,
- what we are offering to the public and to city teams,
- and how the platform solves the problem in everyday terms.

If you are a technical reader, you can continue to the architecture sections below.

## The Problem We Are Solving

Air pollution data usually has three big gaps:

1. Information is hard to understand.
- Most people only see a number (for example AQI 180), but they do not know what it means for their family today.
- People need simple answers: Is it safe to go outside? Should children avoid sports? Is a mask needed?

2. Information is not local enough.

- Air quality changes from neighborhood to neighborhood.
- One city-level average cannot represent what is happening in each ward.
- Citizens and municipal teams need hyper-local visibility.

3. Information is not actionable.

- Even when bad air is detected, there is often no direct guidance on what to do next.
- City teams need help identifying likely causes (traffic, dust, biomass burning, industry) and need practical response recommendations.

VAYU is designed to close these gaps by turning raw environmental signals into understandable, local, and actionable intelligence.

## What We Are Offering

VAYU offers two connected products in one platform.

### A. Citizen Experience

For everyday users, we offer:

- Local AQI visibility with location detection and search.
- Easy-to-read pollutant cards (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and others).
- Health guidance in plain language based on current conditions.
- Fire/smoke context where relevant, so people understand when external smoke events may be affecting their area.
- A clean, mobile-friendly interface designed for quick decisions.

In short: we help people understand "What is the air like where I am right now, and what should I do?"

### B. City and Central Administration Experience

For administrative and policy teams, we offer:

- A monitoring dashboard for city-level and ward-level conditions.
- Alert views for severe readings and anomaly situations.
- Source attribution support (likely source categories behind spikes).
- AI-assisted recommendation generation for response planning.
- Role-based access so city admins and central admins see the right data scope.

In short: we help institutions answer "Where is the problem, what is likely causing it, and what should we do first?"

## How We Solve the Problem (Plain-Language Flow)

VAYU works like a multi-layer decision support system.

### Step 1: Collect environmental signals

The platform gathers data from trusted public and satellite-oriented sources (for AQI, weather, geocoding, and fire activity), then combines these with database-stored city and ward context.

What this means in simple terms:

- we do not rely on a single source,
- we cross-check and combine data to improve reliability,
- and we keep historical records so trends and anomalies can be identified.

### Step 2: Convert data into local context

Raw numbers are translated into location-aware context:

- city and ward mapping,
- pollutant-specific values,
- environmental conditions like wind direction and humidity,
- and risk context (for example nearby upwind fires).

This is important because one "bad AQI" number is not enough. People need local interpretation.

### Step 3: Identify possible cause patterns

The platform applies source-detection logic to estimate likely contributors such as:

- traffic,
- construction dust,
- biomass burning,
- industrial activity,
- or unknown/mixed patterns.

This helps turn "what happened" into "why it may be happening."

### Step 4: Generate recommendations

When severe or unusual conditions are detected, the system can generate recommendation outputs for administration teams.

These recommendations are meant to provide:

- immediate actions,
- medium-term actions,
- public advisory language,
- and monitoring suggestions.

So, instead of only detecting a problem, VAYU helps teams respond.

### Step 5: Deliver understandable experiences

The platform presents the information differently for each audience:

- citizens see clear and simple guidance,
- administrators see deeper monitoring and action views.

This dual-design approach ensures that both public safety communication and operational decision-making are supported.

## What Makes VAYU Valuable

1. It is decision-focused, not data-dump focused.

- Many tools stop at "showing readings."
- VAYU focuses on "understanding + response."

2. It supports both people and institutions.

- A single platform serves citizen awareness and government action.

3. It combines multiple perspectives.

- Air quality signals, weather context, fire context, trend logic, and response guidance are brought together.

4. It is built for local reality.

- Ward-level and city-level views support real municipal workflows.

5. It scales from day-to-day checks to incident conditions.

- Citizens can quickly check air quality at any time.
- Admin teams can investigate spikes and plan interventions.

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Citizen morning check

A user opens VAYU before leaving home.

- VAYU detects location and fetches current AQI.
- The user sees pollutant levels and a health advisory.
- If smoke risk is elevated, the user sees extra caution context.

Outcome: fast, clear personal decision support.

### Scenario 2: City AQI spike

A ward experiences unusual AQI increase.

- The dashboard highlights the ward and anomaly score.
- Source detection suggests likely contributors.
- Recommendation output suggests immediate and short-term actions.

Outcome: faster administrative prioritization and response.

### Scenario 3: Regional fire influence

Satellite fire hotspots indicate potential upwind smoke impact.

- Fire risk is associated with affected areas.
- Admin teams can correlate AQI and smoke context.
- Citizens receive clearer explanation of likely cause.

Outcome: better situational awareness during complex events.

## Trust, Responsibility, and Limits

VAYU is a decision-support platform, not a medical device and not an enforcement authority.

Important interpretation principles:

- Values and classifications support awareness and planning.
- Recommendations are guidance outputs that should be reviewed by responsible authorities.
- In rapidly changing conditions, users should combine platform insights with official local advisories.

## 1. Executive Summary

VAYU is a full-stack air quality intelligence platform that serves two primary audiences:

- Citizens who need hyper-local AQI visibility and practical health guidance.
- Administrators (city and central) who need monitoring, anomaly detection, source attribution, and policy response workflows.

The platform is built on Next.js App Router, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime), satellite and public environmental APIs, and a layered internal service architecture for caching, source detection, and policy recommendation generation.

## 7. Data Architecture (Supabase + Postgres)

### 7.1 Core Tables and Data Domains

Key domain tables from migrations:

- `locations`: geographic entities (city/ward/landmark/custom).
- `aqi_readings`: AQI and pollutant measurements with timestamps.
- `pollution_sources`: source classification outputs and confidence.
- `policy_recommendations`: generated recommendation records.
- `user_profiles`: user role/profile metadata.
- `admin_invitations`: invite-code-based admin onboarding.
- `fire_snapshots`: periodic regional fire summaries.
- `weather_cache`: weather context caching table.
- `cron_logs`: operational run logs.
- `push_subscriptions`: browser push subscription endpoints.

Type definitions are reflected in:

- `types/database.ts`
- `types/aqi.ts`
- `types/admin.ts`
- `types/weather.ts`
- `types/geocoding.ts`

### 7.2 Migration Evolution

Migration progression under `supabase/migrations/`:

- Initial schema and enums.
- Cron/cache support tables.
- Admin role and invitation flow support.
- Fire risk and snapshot support.
- Realtime enablement for AQI-related streaming.
- Push subscription support.
- Anomaly score addition for AQI readings.

### 7.3 Security Model

Security design includes:

- Supabase Auth for identity and session.
- Row-level security policies on domain tables.
- Admin role checks at middleware and query-helper layers.
- Cron endpoint secret validation (`CRON_SECRET`).
- Per-endpoint rate limiting for selected public APIs.

## 8. Realtime and Notification Architecture

### 8.1 Realtime

Realtime channel logic:

- AQI subscription hook: `lib/realtime/useAQISubscription.ts`.
- Singleton-style global channel handling to avoid duplicate subscriptions.
- Retries and reconnect behavior for channel failures.
- Store synchronization into `useAQIStore`.

### 8.2 Push Notification Pipeline

Current implemented pieces:

- Client registration and subscription persistence in `lib/push-notification.ts`.
- Browser service worker registration via `public/sw.js`.
- Cron route for push dispatch exists but currently placeholder (`app/api/cron/push-alerts/route.ts`).

## 9. End-to-End Data Pipeline

### 9.1 Ingestion and Enrichment

Main orchestration occurs in `app/api/cron/refresh-data/route.ts`:

- Validates authorization (cron secret or central admin).
- Prefetches regional fire hotspots.
- Iterates over location inventory.
- Pulls weather context and AQI values.
- Computes adjusted AQI/dispersion context.
- Upserts readings into `aqi_readings`.
- Runs source detection and anomaly update path.
- Triggers recommendation generation on anomaly thresholds.
- Logs job status in `cron_logs`.

### 9.2 Citizen Query Path

Typical citizen request path:

1. Browser obtains GPS or fallback location.
2. Geocode API resolves contextual address/city info.
3. AQI API returns latest source-based AQI with pollutant data.
4. Optional fire risk details are fetched and rendered.
5. UI displays advisory and pollutant cards.

### 9.3 Admin Intelligence Path

Typical admin intelligence path:

1. Dashboard query fetches scoped readings (city-aware filtering).
2. Alerts and ward views prioritize high AQI/anomaly items.
3. Source-detection views summarize dominant source contributions.
4. Recommendation API produces policy actions and persists response.

## 10. Operational Tooling

Scripts in `scripts/` support:

- City-wise data seeding for multiple cities.
- Admin invitation seeding (`npm run seed:admin`).
- Data/realtime validation checks.
- Fresh-data generation for development/testing.

Deployment and environment:

- Vercel deployment configuration in `vercel.json`.
- Next.js runtime configuration in `next.config.ts`.
- Supabase project config in `supabase/config.toml`.

## 11. Architecture Strengths

Notable strengths:

- Clear persona separation (citizen vs admin) with route-group architecture.
- Rich integration stack combining environmental, meteorological, and geospatial signals.
- Strong DB-backed operational model (cron logs, snapshots, invitation flow).
- Practical resilience patterns: caching, fallback responses, and retry logic.
- Tight coupling of anomaly/source intelligence to operational recommendations.

## 12. Current Gaps and Observed Maturity Notes

Observed implementation reality based on code:

- `app/api/cron/push-alerts/route.ts` is currently scaffolded/placeholder.
- Citizen forecast UI currently uses generated placeholder values in page logic.
- README stack claims differ from current code in at least one case:
  - README mentions Next.js 15; `package.json` currently uses Next.js 16.1.6.
- Middleware currently requires bearer secret for cron routes; central-admin fallback authorization exists in the cron refresh route handler but middleware gate still applies first.

## 14. Summary

VAYU is architected as a layered, data-centric platform combining citizen utility and administrative decision support. It fuses direct measurements, satellite context, weather signals, rule-based source attribution, and AI-generated policy response into a cohesive operational product. The current codebase is already broad and production-oriented in structure, with clear pathways to complete remaining feature scaffolds (notably push-alert dispatch logic and fuller consistency between docs and implementation).

## 15. Non-Technical Glossary

- AQI (Air Quality Index): A single score that indicates how clean or polluted the air is.
- PM2.5 / PM10: Tiny particles in air; smaller particles can travel deeper into lungs.
- Anomaly: A reading that looks unusually high or different compared to normal patterns.
- Source Detection: Estimating likely causes of pollution (for example traffic or dust).
- Fire Risk Context: Information showing if nearby fires may be contributing to smoke and poor air quality.
- Geocoding: Converting location names to map coordinates, or coordinates to location names.
- Realtime Updates: New readings appearing in the app soon after they are recorded.
- Recommendation Engine: System that proposes possible response actions for administrators.
- Role-Based Access: Different users see different data and controls based on permissions.
- Cron Job: A scheduled background task that runs automatically at fixed intervals.

3. Can VAYU explain why pollution increased?

- It provides likely cause categories using pattern-based logic and supporting context, helping users and admins interpret spikes.

4. Does VAYU help with action planning?

- Yes. Admin workflows include alerting, source context, and recommendation outputs to support operational decisions.

5. Is this a replacement for official advisories?

- No. It is a decision-support system that should complement official government and health guidance.

6. What is the biggest benefit of VAYU?

- It transforms complex environmental data into understandable and actionable guidance for both citizens and administration teams.

## 17. Technical Architecture Approach (Detailed)

This section explains how the platform is engineered from a systems perspective and why these choices were made.

### 17.1 Architecture Principles

VAYU follows a practical set of architecture principles:

- Reliability over novelty: stable data ingestion and clear fallbacks are prioritized.
- Explainability over black-box behavior: source detection and recommendation context are stored and traceable.
- Persona-driven design: citizen workflows and admin workflows are intentionally separate.
- Progressive intelligence: simple rules, contextual data, and AI outputs are layered, not mixed blindly.
- Operational visibility: cron logs, snapshots, and structured tables make the system monitorable.

### 17.2 Layered Technical Design

The platform is organized into six operational layers.

Layer 1: Experience Layer

- Citizen interfaces for location-based AQI awareness and health guidance.
- Admin interfaces for monitoring, anomaly handling, and policy workflows.

Layer 2: API Orchestration Layer

- Route handlers provide controlled access to data and intelligence endpoints.
- API layer normalizes payloads for frontend consumption.

Layer 3: Intelligence Layer

- Source attribution logic and anomaly processing.
- RAG-backed recommendation generation for policy output.

Layer 4: Integration Layer

- External providers for AQI/weather/fire/geocoding.
- Abstraction modules to avoid provider lock-in in business logic.

Layer 5: Data Layer

- Supabase Postgres with typed tables and migration-based evolution.
- Realtime event channel for near-live UI updates.

Layer 6: Operations Layer

- Scheduled jobs for refresh and enrichment.
- Seeding scripts and verification scripts for deployment lifecycle.

### 17.3 Data Fusion Strategy

VAYU combines multiple environmental signals and treats them as complementary rather than equivalent.

How fusion is handled:

- Primary AQI path favors direct observation routes.
- Satellite and fire signals enrich interpretation when direct readings are sparse or uncertain.
- Weather vectors are used to improve contextual causality (for example wind-based smoke plausibility).
- Location intelligence aligns readings to city and ward analysis views.

Why this matters:

- Single-source systems often fail under sparse coverage.
- Fusion improves continuity, risk context quality, and explanatory depth.

### 17.4 Decision Pipeline Design

VAYU uses a staged decision pipeline:

- Detect: ingest and cache observations.
- Interpret: classify source likelihood and anomaly context.
- Recommend: generate actionable response outputs.
- Deliver: present audience-specific messages and dashboards.

This staged approach ensures that recommendations are generated from structured context instead of isolated raw values.

### 17.5 Security and Governance Approach

Security architecture combines platform-level and data-level controls:

- Authentication through managed identity sessions.
- Authorization through role-scoped routes and query filters.
- Data protection through row-level policies and endpoint checks.
- Scheduler protection through secret-protected cron endpoints.

Governance stance:

- Administrative actions are constrained by role and city scope.
- Recommendation outputs are persisted for traceability and review.
- Operational logs support post-incident analysis.

### 17.6 Scalability Approach

## 18. Feasibility Assessment (Technical + Operational)

This section evaluates whether the platform can be implemented and operated effectively in real conditions.

### 18.1 Technical Feasibility

Feasibility status: High.

Reasons:

- The system uses widely adopted technologies with strong ecosystem support.
- Core capabilities are already implemented end-to-end in the repository.
- The architecture avoids hard coupling to a single provider in most flows.

Feasibility by capability:

- AQI lookup and context rendering: already viable and operational.
- Ward/city monitoring workflows: already viable with role filtering.
- Source detection and anomaly support: viable with iterative calibration.
- Recommendation generation: viable with fallback logic and cooldown safeguards.
- Push pipeline: partially feasible now; final dispatch logic completion needed.

### 18.2 Data Feasibility

Feasibility status: Medium-to-High, dependent on source consistency.

Strengths:

- Multi-source architecture reduces single-point data dependency.
- Cached and persisted records support trend continuity.

Constraints:

- External provider outages and quota policies can affect freshness.
- Spatial density of direct observations varies by location.

Mitigation strategy:

- Layered fallback paths and response annotations.
- Data quality checks in cron and monitoring scripts.
- Historical baselines to reduce overreaction to isolated spikes.

### 18.3 Operational Feasibility

Feasibility status: High for pilot and phased production.

Why:

- Operational scripts are present for setup and data checks.
- Scheduled jobs and logging provide basic run-control.
- Role model supports controlled admin onboarding.

Operational needs for broader rollout:

- Runbook for incident handling and source outage response.
- Alert thresholds tuned per region and season.
- Release checklist for migration compatibility and cron integrity.

### 18.4 Organizational Feasibility

Feasibility status: High if governance ownership is clear.

Required ownership model:

- Product/communications owner for citizen messaging standards.
- Environmental analytics owner for threshold/source rule calibration.
- Platform operations owner for uptime, ingestion cadence, and QA.

Without clear ownership, even technically sound systems lose policy impact.
